For Goal comment calculation:

goal.time_left = "YYYY-MM-DD" (in the datetime format)
goal_split = str(goal.time_left).split("-") (converts to string then splits into year, month, day)
year = goal_split[0]
month = goal_split[1]
day = goal_split[2]

if year > 0:
print("You have {year} years to meet your goal")

elif month > 0:
print("You have {month} months to meet your goal")

elif day > 0:
print("You have {day} days to meet your goal")

else:
print("Your goal due date has passed. Please update your goal")
