Things to correct:
- refactor the code so monthly_recurring parameter is changed to pin_money_transaction. The boolean is incorrect when viewing the app.
- create a method so that the goal contributions are taken off of the available funds for the month. 
- create a way to view the next month / previous month from the home screen.
